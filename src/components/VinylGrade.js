                <p>Mint (M) Absolutely perfect in every way. Never been played and usually sealed.</p>
                <p>Excellent (E) The vinyl has only been played a few times. There are no marks on the vinyl and the whole package is complete. Small signs of use.</p>
                <p>Very Good Plus (VG+) A few further faults are acceptable, but nothing that compromises the record visually or audibly. Light inaudible marks or background crackle.</p>
                <p>Very Good (VG) Visually and audibly used. Light pops and clicks, an edge split, light visible scratches. You can still enjoy listening and the record looks good.</p>
                <p>Good (G) Good mean bad condition. Usually only highly sought after records would sell in this condition.</p>
                <p>Fair (F) Expect major noise issues, skipping or repeating. The record itself is cracked, badly warped and has deep scratches.</p>
